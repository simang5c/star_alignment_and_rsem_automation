# star_alignment_and_rsem_automation
This is a simple program to automate star alignment and quantification using RSEM. 

## Tips and Tricks before executing the program

1.Download both the python file and shell script and store it in a folder. For example: if My fastq files are in the directory "fastq_files", i will download the two programs and store it in the "scripts" directory which is under "fastq_files" directory. 

2.E.g. In my case, to pass the name of the fastq file i just need to add "../{filename}_R1.fastq". 

3.Please put complete link to your star aligner and rsem when you execute the program. 

4.Only star_alignment_and_rsem_automation.py file should be executed, the programs call and execute the shell script by itself.


Cheers!
